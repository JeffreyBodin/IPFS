## Notes (2021-06-17_1227)

As of 2021-06-17 (Initial Commit)
  - I plan to
  Convert my surrent above URL. To my Ethereum ENS address. (JeffreyBodin.eth)
  Or least point to in some way. Is possible to my understanding.
  
  Currently my ENS address is in use solely for direction of ETH based transactions. 
  As an address, to the registered addresses. For the ENS domain registry.
